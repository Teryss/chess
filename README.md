# Chess game
It's a standard chess program written in python using pygame, but the current state is *NOT* finished.

# Running
In order to run, you need to have the hierarchy as in repo. You can also look up the code to see how the things are looking like.

# Current state
As said before, it's not finished and there are some bugs and for now game is unplayable
